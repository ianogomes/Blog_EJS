# Blog_EJS
The primary goal of this project is simply practicing my back-end skills using node, express and ejs initially. In this case, the website I am developing is a blog, and the project is based on a challenge from the following web development course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/

Later on, I will probably expand this project to practice my skills with databases too.
